# PVCharacterization

The aim of the project is to design and create a tool for optical characterization of thin and transparent materials. More details can be found on [the official website](http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/pv-characterization).

## Setup
The repository contains 3 main components:

* The **Arduino firmware** that is in charge of controlling the electro-mechanical system (found under `firmware`)
* The cross-platform **driver** allowing a computer to communicate with the firmware living in the Arduino (found under `driver`)
* The **GUI** of the laptop application (found under `GUI`)
